SubTracker is a simple, unified application designed to help you stay on top of all your subscriptions whether they’re online services like Netflix or Spotify, or real-world essentials like electricity or water bills. With SubTracker, you can easily 

create, update, and delete transactions tied to each subscription, making it easier to manage your recurring expenses in one place.

**Why did I build this?**
From personal experience I noticed a common issue: people often forget about subscriptions they signed up for. Whether it's an online service or a real-world utility, they end up getting charged for something they no longer use or need. That moment of confusion “Why was I charged for this?” is exactly what SubTracker aims to prevent.
