SubTracker is an application that allows you to track you subscriptions across the board for instance online subs like streaming services or actual utilities like electrecity and so on. it also allows you to create, update and delete transactions of a subscription. SubTracker is a unified place to track all your sub related expanses. **Why did I choose this project you may ask?** From my own expeirence I heard a lot of people pay a sub fee to certin things either online or in real life then forget about it after a while. What happens after they foget about them? well yeah they get charged and wonder why did they get charged for a service or something they do not use anymore. This is why I created this application to avoid these scenarios and to have a unified place to track all you subscriptions.
